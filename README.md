# Face-Landmarks-Detection
In this project, we build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. The code is able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face; examples of these keypoints are displayed below.

The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks.
**Notebook 1**  : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

**Notebook 2**  : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

**Notebook 3**  : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN

**Notebook 4**  : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses
